A directory is the "nesting of folders", the place where files are stored. Usually arranged in a hierarchical nature with a "root" locaiton (the origin or stem from which the files are organized). Directories organize files (which can be everything from text files, images, audio, and more) and provide a structure to filing and locating files.
VCS stands for Version Control System, which is a system that saves and catalogues version histories. On Github for example, when you make changes to your directory, the version histories (initial and updated) are saved in a chain, and further edits will create new versions, but prior versions will be saved as well to return to at any point if necessary.
I don't have a single favorite artistic medium, but I always admire photography, painting, illustration, and videography. To me, photography and videography is about the capturing of a moment in a single snapshot or length of video from the perspective of the one behind the camera. Illustration and painting gives lots of free range to create and the variety of design (ranging from strict, traditional paintings to comical and informal illlustrations for a logo). It's what I enjoy about most if not all mediums, it is capturing a feeling, idea, or moment the artist is in control of creating from their point of view. I have definitely been more interested in digital medium more and more as proficiency in these digital creative spaces are more and more important.
