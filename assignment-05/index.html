      What I Love About My Jeep

      I drive a 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport. A compact 4x4 powered by a 3.7L V6. Though this is not a Wrangler or other more common "off roader", this vehicle is plenty capable and perfectly suits our needs as college students in Western Montana. We enjoy fishing, hiking, hunting, camping, and overall exploring nature and this truck allows us to reach places cars sometimes cannot. Though there are no serious modificaitons currently, I'm looking to install auxillary lights to illuminate dark trails and wildlife in the coming weeks before we embark on any trips.
