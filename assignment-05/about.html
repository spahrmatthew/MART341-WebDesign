      Why Do I Love 4x4 Vehicles?
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I wouldn't consider myself a fanatic by any means, but when I first moved to Montana and experienced my first REAL winter, I was blown away by how useful (and necessary) owning a vehicle with AWD or 4x4 is. Beyond this necessity, my dad owned a 2006 Toyota Tacoma TRD. This was my favorite vehicle; it was present in just about every memory of hunting, fishing, camping, exploring national parks, and more throughout my childhood. My dad got in an awful crash last semester due to the ice and this truck saved my dad's life; it didn't crumble after the rollovers and protected my father from almost certain critical injuries. By the time the paramedics arrived, the truck was a twisted pile of steel and rubber. Their comment to my dad, "Wow, we've never seen someone walk away from something that serious". To me, this vehicle represented all the fond memories from growing up and its final impact it made was protecting my dad in a freak accident. So this is why I enjoy my Jeep now, is that I think of the memories that I'll create with this vehicle, the same way that Toyota did for me.
