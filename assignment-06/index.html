      My Jeep's stock configuration

    <h2>
      Overview of build I want to complete
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Accessory lighting (<i><strong>i.e. </i></strong> auxillary spot beams and amber driving lights)
      <li> Roof rack for basket
      <li> More aggressive All Terrain tires
      <li> Gas can mount on basket
      <li> <i><strong>*If my budget allows*</strong></i> A steel bumper/brush guard
    </ul>

    <h2>
    <b>  Priorities and rationale behind list </b>
    </h2>
        My main priority is functionality and versatility with my Jeep.
        I have been facinated with LED lighting for vehicles after a camping trip last year, where having this extra lighting would be so useful in navigating dark roads where wildlife are prone to running out in the way.
        So this would be the highest priority to ensure that my time on the trail is not cut short due to a lack of visibility. A roof rack system would allow for lots of configurability for trips, but a cargo basket would allow me to have extra space for gear that wouldn't necessarily need to be in the cabin. All terrain tires would allow for more grip on gravel and dirt roads creating a safer ride. Carrying extra gasoline in remote areas is essential in the event that I or someone in my group runs out of gas, but I'd like it to be locked up on the exterior to make sure fumes don't cause a deadly situation in the vehicle. Finally, the optional piece, is a steel bumper. To me, this would be the final piece to ensuring that if wildlife jumps out in front of my vehicle (<i> heavan forbid </i>), this would protect the front of the vehicle and likely preserve the frame. This build will take time and money, hence why it will be done in pieces over time, but this is the general plan for customizing my Jeep to meet my needs the best.
