            The idea for this site began after a long conversation with my brother about the things I enjoy, what influences my worldview, and what some of my goals are. There isn't enough time to condense ALL of my thoughts onto a single about page, but the goal is to feature and share a couple of general answers within each of these subcategories. My parents taught me from an early age to seek new challenges and experiences wherever I go; to be hungry for life itself. And through everything; moving states, moving schools, leaving a comfort zone; I feel that this philosophy has helped shape who I am. I hope to share this philosophy of embracing the discomfort from trying something new or difficult (safely and within reason of course), we begin to fully realize what we are capable of and passionate about. This blog seeks to share this philosophy to as many people we can reach through quality work and a dedication to exploring the world.
